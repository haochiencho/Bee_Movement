# Alien Arm Hierarchy
The arms of the space ship move in a hierarchical motion with 3 levels.

# Structure
Every part that is drawn is put into functions. E.g draw ship, draw pyramid,
draw background, and draw floor plane. Functions that are only called once are put into
anonymous functions, unnamed functions.

# Flat Shading and Custom Object
The pyramid is a custom shape that has vertices, normals, and texture coordinates
calculated to fit a shape of the pyramid. Texture of the pyramid is based off the
pyramid.png image. Flat shading is used by setting all the normals on a single
plane are the have the same.
